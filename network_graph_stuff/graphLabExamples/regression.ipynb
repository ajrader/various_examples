    "\n",
    "* Linear regression\n",
    "* Boosted Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "These algorithms differ in how they make predictions, but conform to the same API. With all models, call create() to create a model, predict() to make predictions on the returned model, and evaluate() to measure performance of the predictions. All models can incorporate:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Numeric features\n",
    "* Categorical variables\n",
    "* Sparse features (i.e feature sets that have a large set of features, of which only a small subset of values are non-zero)\n",
    "* Dense features (i.e feature sets with a large number of numeric features)\n",
    "* Text data\n",
    "* Images\n",

    "It isn't always clear that we know exactly which model is suitable for a given task. GraphLab Create's model selector automatically picks the right model for you based on statistics collected from the data set."

First a model is created (or trained), using training data. Once the model is created, it can then be used to make predictions on new examples that were not seen in training (the test data). Model creation, prediction, and evaluation work will data that is contained in an SFrame. The following figure illustrates how linear regression works. Notice that the functional form learned here is a linear function (unlike the previous figure where the predicted function was non-linear).\n",
