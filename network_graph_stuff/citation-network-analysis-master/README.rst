Citation Network Analysis
===================================

This repo contains the materials for my PyData 2013 talk on citation network
analysis. To get set up, do something like the following:

    $ virtualenv pydata2013

    $ source ./pydata2013/bin/activate

    $ git clone git@github.com:twneale/citation-network-analysis.git

    $ cd citation-network-analysis

    # Note: if the follwing step fails, you're missing dependencies. If resolving them is not you're cup of tea,
    # I recommend installing the free anaconda distribution of python from Continuum Analytics: https://store.continuum.io/
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

The ipython notebook server instance is running here: https://23.21.44.130:8888/.
